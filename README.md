1.  **Data Collection:** Sensors feed live data (e.g., soil moisture) to the backend via MQTT/HTTP, informing irrigation recommendations.
2.  **AI Analysis:** The AI module evaluates crop health and predicts disease risks by analyzing environmental patterns.
3.  **Dashboard Insights:** The web dashboard displays trends, alerts, and suggested actions (e.g., ‚ÄúIrrigate Zone 2 for 10 minutes‚Äù).
4.  **Automation in Action:** The Automation Control Panel can trigger irrigation or initiate the robotic arm for planting based on your plans.
5.  **Precise Planting:** The Robotic Planting Arm follows an optimized path to create holes, plant seeds, and maintain spacing.
6.  **Smart Layouts:** The Garden Planner takes your dimensions and crop percentages to create practical layouts and planting counts.
